**Abstract:**
Topologically Associating Domains
(TADs) represent a critical aspect of the
three-dimensional organization of
chromosomes within the nucleus,
influencing gene expression and cellular
function. Understanding TADs is
paramount for insights into the
mechanisms of genetic regulation, the
maintenance of cellular identity, and the
development of disease.In addition recent
advance in sequencing technologies have
dramatically enhanced our capacity to map
the three-dimensional genome architecture,
reducing both time and cost while
significantly increasing data resolution.
Here we present an attempt to identified
and characterize TADs and their
boundaries by developing a Gaussian
Hidden Markov Model.

**Intrudcution:**
Recent years have seen significant
progress in our understanding of how
animal genomes are spatial organized,
thanks in part to the advancement of
chromosome conformation capture
(3C) methods and improvements in live cell
imaging techniques. These methods have
greatly enhanced our understating of the
genome's structural layout. The 3C process
involves cutting crosslinked chromatin
with restriction enzymes, then joining
these pieces in a way that reflects their
spatial proximity within the nucleus,
creating chimeric molecules that signify
interactions between genomic regions. 2HiC, a technique that applies the principles of
3C across the entire genome, has
increasingly refined our ability to observe
the genome's three-dimensional folding at
various levels of organization and enabling
the quantitative analysis of physical
contacts between genomic regions across
the entire genome3. These advancements
led to the discovery of TADs, highlighting
the hierarchical organization of the
genome and underscoring the spatial
context of gene regulation.
TADs are defined as contiguous genomic
regions where DNA sequences interact
more frequently with each other than with
sequences outside the domain, mediated by
proteins like CTCF and cohesin. This
organization facilitates the proximity of
genes and their regulatory elements, such
as enhancers, enabling precise control over
gene expression crucial for development
and differentiation processes.
Identifying the boundaries of TADs is vital
for decoding the genome's regulatory
architecture. These boundaries often
contain insulator
elements that block the
spread of heterochromatin and restrict
enhancer-promoter interactions within
TADs, maintaining specific gene
expression patterns. Alterations in TAD
structures or their boundaries are
associated with various diseases,
highlighting the importance of
understanding TAD.
